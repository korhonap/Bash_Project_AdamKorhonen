For my Bash Project, I first created 5 files that each contain one word. The words, when added together, say "This Is My Bash Project". This script combines the word in each of the 5 files in order to create one output file that is a combination of all of the words from all of the files. This would be useful in the real world to combine something like log files together into one place, and have all of the details of a security incident combined into one document.
